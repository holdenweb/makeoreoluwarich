A service that logs a twitter account's contacts to allow re-contacting from a new account

It's not relly intended to make anyone rich, but the name will
hopefully stop the service getting swamped until it's ready to
scale with proven demand and sound finances (which, given the
statistics, is pretty unlikely - in which case it's a training
ground).
